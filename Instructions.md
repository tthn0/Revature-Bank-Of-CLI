# Project Specification: Bank of CLI

## 1. Overview

Welcome to the **Bank of CLI** project! In this project, you will build a functional banking application that runs entirely within the terminal. Your goal is to move from a simple user interface down to a persistent database, applying what you've learned about Java, SQL, and Agile development.

## 2. Your Mission (MVP Features)

You are responsible for delivering a "Core Ledger" that supports the following operations:

- **Secure Access:** Users must be able to register and log in using a unique `Account ID` and `PIN`.
- **Balance Management:** Users can check their current account balance at any time.
- **The Transaction Engine:**
  - `Deposit`: Add funds to an account.
  - `Withdraw`: Remove funds (the system must prevent overdrawing!).
  - `Transfer`: Move money securely between two different accounts.
- **Audit Trail:** Users can view their recent transaction history.
- **System Logging:** The application must maintain a log file to track activity. You are required to use:
  - `INFO`: To record successful actions (e.g., "User successfully logged in").
  - `ERROR`: To record failures or security risks (e.g., "Incorrect PIN entered" or "Database connection lost").

## 3. Architecture & Technical Requirements

To build a scalable and maintainable application, you must follow a **Layered Architecture**. Do not skip layers; each has a specific job:

1.  **API Layer (The Interface):** This is what the user sees. It handles all terminal inputs, menu navigation, and printing messages. This layer _only_ talks to the Service Layer.
2.  **Business Layer (The Brains):** This is where the banking rules live (e.g., "Can this user afford this withdrawal?"). It receives calls from the API and calls the Repository Layer
3.  **Repository Layer (The Vault):** This layer handles all communication with the SQL database. It converts SQL rows into Java objects and vice versa. It _only_ receives calls from the Business Layer.

### The Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java
- **Build Tool:** Maven
- **Database:** Postgres
- **Testing:** JUnit 5
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 4. Quality Standards: The "2-Test Rule"

We don't just want code that works; we want code that is _proven_ to work. For **every** single method you write in the Service and Repository layers, you must provide at least two JUnit 5 tests:

1.  **The Positive Test:** Prove the method works when everything goes right (e.g., a successful deposit).
2.  **The Negative Test:** Prove the method handles errors correctly (e.g., attempting to withdraw more money than is available should be rejected gracefully).

## 5. Professional Implementation Guidelines

As you build, keep these "Gold Standards" in mind:

- **Atomicity (All or Nothing):** When performing a `Transfer`, the deduction from one account and the addition to another must happen as one single unit. If one part fails, the whole operation must fail so that money never "vanishes."
- **Smart Error Handling:**
  - **User-Friendly Messages:** If a user makes a mistake (like an incorrect PIN), show them a clear, helpful message.
  - **Security First:** If the database crashes, do **not** show the user a scary technical stack trace. Instead, log the technical error and show the user a polite "Service Unavailable" type message.

**Good luck, and happy coding!**

| **Multilayered Application**           | Application demonstrates a clear multilayer architecture (e.g., presentation/UI, business/service layer, data/access layer) with appropriate separation of concerns. |  **15%** |
| **Account Management Feature**         | Users can create and sign into bank accounts with their ID and pin.                                                                                                  |  **10%** |
| **Check Account Balance**              | Users can view the current balance of their account(s), with accurate values displayed.                                                                              |  **10%** |
| **Withdraw & Deposit Funds**           | Users can successfully deposit and withdraw funds, with account balances updated appropriately.                                                                      |  **15%** |
| **Transfer Funds Between Accounts**    | Users can transfer funds from one account to another, with appropriate balance updates and validation.                                                               |  **15%** |
| **View Transaction History**           | Users can view a history of transactions.                                                                                                                            |  **10%** |
| **Logging: Info & Error Messages**     | Demonstrates at least one **INFO** message and one **ERROR** message written to a log. Messages should be meaningful and demonstrate appropriate logging practices.  |  **10%** |
| **Testing: Positive & Negative Tests** | Demonstrates at least one **positive test** and one **negative test**, and both tests must pass. Tests should meaningfully validate application behavior.            |  **15%** |
